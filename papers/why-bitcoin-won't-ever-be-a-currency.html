        <div class = 'scroll-content'>I saw this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lra6ps/im_honestly_not_buying_this_billionaire_bitcoin/">post</a> on reddit a while ago about how this guy didn’t like that billionaires and hedge funds are investing in bitcoin. The post didn’t really make sense to me because of one particular line he said “Not to mention that we all expected BTC to become peer-to-peer cash, not a store of value for edgy hedge funds”. And you might say to them, “well that sounds right, it's supposed to be a currency after all.” And you're partially right. In the BTC whitepaper it calls bitcoin a peer to peer version of electronic cash that is meant to circumvent financial institutions, but if you look at the way that bitcoin is designed it was never meant to be a currency. This is because of a few key differences between it and fiat currency and for some reason I haven't heard anyone talking about them. 
            First off we have limited supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. This is a problem because of a key principle in finance. Now to explain this I'm going to ask you a question, would you rather have 100 dollars now or 10 dollars every year for the next 20 years? What would you answer? Every good investor would immediately tell you 100 dollars now. This is because of inflation. You don’t know what the value of the dollar is going to be in 20 years. The only definite thing you know is that 1 dollar is going to be worth less tomorrow than it is today. So as an investor or even a consumer this causes you to either want to store your value in another medium like stocks, bonds, or commodities or to want to spend your money because most of the time the cheapest an item is going to be is right now even if the dollar amount of the item is the same in the future. Now let's do the same situation but we time travel back to 2010 when the price of bitcoin was less than one cent and ask the same question. Would you rather have 100 bitcoin now or 20 bitcoin every year for the next 10 years. Everyone would say 20 bitcoin a year because bitcoin goes up in value. I would end up making twice as much money. So unlike fiat currency cryptocurrency doesn’t promote spending which is the whole basis for the economy. If there is no spending then there is no economy. This also becomes an issue when you consider spreading out only 21 million of a single currency to the whole of the human population. I mean there is 2.1 trillion in US dollars currently and the USD is only 1 of 185 currencies. Even if you broke down every bitcoin to 1 satoshi which is 1 100,000,000th of a bitcoin you still wouldn't have enough bitcoin to go around especially when you consider that a lot of bitcoins are stuck in wallets that can’t be accessed for one reason or another. 1 million bitcoins are stuck in satoshi nakamoto(the founder of bitcoin)’s wallet and he hasn’t moved any of them ever and we have no reason to say that he will ever move them.
            The second reason is the rate of transfer. Bitcoin by design can only verify 1MB of transactions every ten minutes. In the future I am going to make a video further explaining how bitcoin and crypto in general works but for now thats all you need to know. 1 MB every ten minutes becomes a serious problem when you think about how many transactions happen in a span of ten minutes all around the world. The number is probably in the millions. I mean imagine a world where you go to the store, you get all of your groceries and you have to check out and swipe your card then have to wait for ten whole minutes before the system says you have paid. That’s the best case scenario as well. When making bitcoin transactions if the line to have your transaction verified is already more than 1MB then you have to wait until the next block of transactions. Even today with how popular bitcoin is you have to wait 30 
            minutes sometimes more to have your transaction included in a block. Now imagine that but with millions of transactions every couple of minutes. You might end up waiting in that grocery store for a couple hours to days before your transaction gets verified. Now having said all of this there are other cryptocurrencies that have addressed this issue and could handle the traffic but I can’t think of a single one that doesn't have one or more of the other issues I list. If you do know of a currency that checks all of the boxes that bitcoin doesn’t and I just haven’t heard of it then leave a comment I would love to hear about it.
            The third reason is that governments like to have control over their currency because it affects a lot of the economy. To understand how governments control currency and how it affects the economy we need to first understand a concept called fractional reserve banking. FRB is the concept that banks only need to hold 10% of all of their liabilities or the cash that people have put into their bank. Banks then take the other 90% of that cash and loan it out. This is a great concept for everyone involved. You get to keep your money in a secure place and have the convenience of being able to access it whenever you want. Banks get to make money off of interest and the person getting the loan gets access to money that they otherwise wouldn't have. The only problem is that people like to spend and when people spend the banks cash reserves may go below the critical 10%. So as a bank what do you do? You need to get more cash in the form of a loan. This can come from one of two places. Other banks or the central bank run by the government. The interest on such a loan helps to determine what the interest rate that a bank charges for on one of their loans is. This interest rate has a special name: the overnight rate. This is because banks “settle their balance sheets” overnight when the banks are closed and people aren't spending as much. Now hopefully this all makes sense but wait you say “what does all of this have to do with the government controlling currency, the central bank could still give out loans just in a crypto currency and still affect the interest rates.” And to that I would say that if the world all has one currency then what is stopping the banks from getting a loan from another countries central bank. After all the banks only have an allegiance to making money and so they will pick the party that offers them a loan with the lowest interest rate. This would affect the interest rates in the country where the bank resides and governments don’t like other governments meddling in their economy. But why are interest rates so important to the economy? Well imagine that you are looking to buy a new house. You need a loan to buy said house. Well if the interest rates are high then it will be harder for you to to get that loan and it may even cause you to say well is it really worth it if i'm going to spend that much in interest. This causes the economy to slow down and decrease because less people have money to spend. Conversely when interest rates are low a lot of people have more money to spend. This causes the economy to grow but it also causes people to feel richer and so they are willing to spend more on goods and services. This is inflation. So it’s pretty important for governments to have a firm control over their interest rates and the way they do that is by being the sole maker and manager of their currency. 
            The final big difference between fiat currency and bitcoin isn't something in it’s design but the public's view of cryptocurrency in general. Unless you have done significant research on crypto and are a part of the crypto space then the only thing that you probably know about it is 
            that people got rich off of it. Bitcoin in particular. The general public doesn’t think about bitcoin as being something that you spend. As far as they know it is just something to invest in. This is why in the United States it is legally considered a commodity. This is a problem that could be solved through more education and actual application, like if stores started to accept bitcoin as payment, however bitcoin also has all of the other problems that we talked about. 
            In the end bitcoin was never even meant to take off or be used practically even as a currency; it was an experiment to see if this new method of creating a cryptocurrency could be used and as soon as it was live it just spread like wildfire. Despite all of it’s flaws bitcoin still does have a bright future not as a currency but as so amazingly put by the redditor who made the original post “a store of value for edgy hedge funds.” Hopefully bitcoin does spread though beyond being only bought by “edy hedge funds” but also being used by banks and people everywhere as a more stable store of value like gold or art. In fact if you look at all of it’s aspects I would say that the US government got it spot on when they legally made it a commodity. So as an investor in crypto and the future of it, seeing banks and large financial institutions start to invest in bitcoin and use it is an amazing sign for what is to come for crypto and definitely a step in the right direction. So sorry to the redditor that rich people are bursting your bubble of bitcoin toppling the system but as an informed investor not just in crypto but in economics as well I see this as the best thing that could happen to bitcoin.
